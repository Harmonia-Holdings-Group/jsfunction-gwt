jsfunction-gwt
==============

Extensive support for passing GWT Java functions to JavaScript APIs that require JavaScript functions.

This library used to be part of the Cesium-GWT repository, but it became too useful to other
non-Cesium projects (such as my OZONE Widget Framework GWT wrappers), and I felt compelled to make it
into an independent project.
